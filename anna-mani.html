      <p>At a time when women&rsquo;s participation in science in India was extremely limited, about 100 years ago on August 23, 1918, Anna Modayil Mani was born in a Travancore Syrian Christian family in Peermade, Mala village in present&hyphen;day Kerala state. She became the first woman scientist at the Indian Meteorological Research Department and was known as the &ldquo;Indian Weather Woman,&rdquo; becoming a pioneer for all women.</p>

      <p>Her father was a civil engineer who owned a cardamom plantation.</p>

      <p>When young Anna turned 8, she refused the diamond necklace her father wanted to give her as a birthday gift and instead insisted on receiving the 10&hyphen;volume Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>

      <p>By the age of 10, young Anna Mani had already read all the books in the Peermade public library.</p>

      <p>In 1925, deeply inspired by Mahatma Gandhi who participated in the Vaikom Struggle, she wore only khadi clothing for the rest of her life.</p>

      <p>Due to her deep interest in physics, she studied at Madras Presidency College and secured first rank in her honors degree.</p>

      <h2>Education and Early Career</h2>
      <p>When she reached marriageable age, Anna Mani was not interested in marriage and devoted her entire life to education.</p>

      <p>Between 1942&ndash;45, at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore, under the guidance of C.V. Raman, she worked on research about the Spectroscopy of Diamonds and Rubies, wrote five research papers, and submitted her doctoral thesis to Madras University in 1945. However, the university refused to award her a doctorate because she lacked a master&rsquo;s degree.</p>

      <p>Finally, based on her research papers, Anna Mani went to England for further studies. She received a scholarship and joined Imperial College of London, where she continued her studies in meteorology.</p>

      <p>It was this education that inspired her to manufacture meteorological instruments in India itself.</p>

      <h2>Career at India Meteorological Department</h2>
      <p>Upon returning to India in 1948, she joined the Pune office of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) as a Grade 2 Meteorologist. It was here that she achieved great success in designing about 100 meteorological instruments.</p>

      <p>Anna Mani joined the Indian Meteorological Research Department in Pune and served as Deputy Director General of the department before retiring in 1976.</p>

      <p>Through her great efforts, about 35 Radiation Observatories were established and operated in India by 1975. She turned her attention to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar energy. As a result, she wrote and published two books: <em>&ldquo;Handbook of Solar Radiation over India&rdquo;</em> (1980) and <em>&ldquo;Solar Radiation Over India&rdquo;</em> (1981).</p>

      <p>Anna Mani and her colleagues introduced in India the method of using Radiosonde &mdash; a device attached to a balloon and sent into the sky to gather meteorological information from the upper layers of the atmosphere (Information: WMO).</p>

      <h2>International Recognition</h2>
      <p>In 1960, through Anna Mani&rsquo;s efforts, India developed the Ozonesonde &mdash; a device to measure ozone levels &mdash; which attracted global attention. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), due to the excellence of Anna&rsquo;s work, appointed her as a member of the International Ozone Commission.</p>

      <p>Anna Mani emphasized the importance of international comparison of meteorological instruments and national standardization of meteorological instruments, and published many articles on these topics. As a result, the World Meteorological Organization appointed her as the first woman chairman of the Commission for Methods of Observations.</p>

      <h2>Later Life</h2>
      <p>After retiring from service in 1976, wanting to continue her educational work, she joined the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore and worked there for some time.</p>

      <p>In 1994, Anna was affected by a stroke and had to return to her hometown, where she was confined to a wheelchair.</p>

      <p>On August 16, 2001, Anna Mani passed away in Thiruvananthapuram.</p>

      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>In a patriarchal society, making education her only ambition, Anna Mani created history as the first Weather Woman of the Indian Meteorological Research Department and is fully deserving of a centenary celebration.</p>

      <p>With this in mind, the purpose of this article is to put forward the demand that the Indian Meteorological Research Department should celebrate her centenary and pay tribute to Anna&rsquo;s greatness to make it known to the world.</p>
